I am a physician-scientist and research fellow at Peng Cheng Laboratory, focusing on the development and clinical translation of large multimodal language models (LLMs) in medicine. My work explores algorithm optimization, multimodal data fusion, and real-world deployment of medical AI systems for diagnosis, triage, and disease prediction.

I have led the training of LLMs based on Qwen, LLaMA, Deepseek, and other frameworks at parameter scales ranging from 7B to 671B, including contributions to Hong Kongâ€™s first sovereign LLM, HKGAI-671B. My team successfully applied these models in randomized controlled trials, demonstrating enhanced diagnostic accuracy and workflow efficiency. 

To date, I have published over 30 peer-reviewed SCI articles as first or corresponding author, and hold multiple national patents in medical AI. I am a recipient of the Chinese Medical Science and Technology Award (2024, Second Prize), Beijing Medical Progress Award (2024, Grand Prize), and the Huaxia Medical Science and Technology Award (2023, First Prize).
